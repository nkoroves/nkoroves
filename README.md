**nkoroves/nkoroves** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational research involving heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. I love all things cardiovascular!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m majoring in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about novels by Yukio Mishima. 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a collection of tiny paintings (2x3 inches) displayed above my desk at home.
